<h3>Thank you for completing the survey!</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify; border-inline: 10px">We are asking you to solve 4 programming tasks in Python language at
    this step. This may take from 10 to 20 minutes.
    The tasks will be presented as 4 separate .ipynb files, with instructions at the top of the file.<br>
    Please note, that we intentionally switched the error highlights in the IDE, and that after you complete the first
    two tasks<b> the appearance of the IDE will change.</b> Please, donâ€™t open or close any tabs in or outside while
    working with the tasks.
